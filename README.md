# Refactoring-Horiseon

 * Description 

The Horiseon Marketing has reached out to have their website refactored, optimized and to make sure it meets accessibility standards. Throughout the html code there was div sections all throughout the code to make the structure of it up. After refactoring the html it now has specific semantic elements within the main body of code. After refactoring it was discovered that one of the links on the homepage were not responding when clicked on. This was resolved by giving it the correct id so that it had a location to go to after being clicked. Finally accessibility standards were met by adding alt attribute tags for every image on the webpage. Creating these atl attributes for every photo gives visually handicap people a description of the photo that cannot be read by the screen reader.
